Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

**DATA MINIMIZATION PRINCIPLE: PwnDroid is designed to collect only the minimum data necessary for its educational and research functionality. Most data processing occurs locally on your device.**

Types of Data Collected

PwnDroid is designed to minimize personal data collection. We do not require personally identifiable information for basic functionality. Any data collected is limited to:

    Usage Data (as defined below)
    Device configuration data necessary for Application functionality
    Error logs and diagnostic information (stored locally)

Usage Data

Usage Data is collected automatically when using the Application and is primarily stored locally on your device.

Usage Data may include information such as:
    Application performance metrics
    Feature usage statistics
    Error logs and diagnostic information
    System configuration data relevant to the Application's operation

**IMPORTANT:** Unlike web-based services, PwnDroid does not collect IP addresses, browser information, or web browsing data as it operates as a local application.

While using Our Application, we may collect the following information, which remains stored locally on your device:

    Device location information (only if explicitly enabled and necessary for specific security research features)
    Network configuration data relevant to the Application's security research functions
    System performance data to ensure optimal Application operation

**DATA LOCALITY:** All collected information is stored locally on your device by default. No data is transmitted to external servers without your explicit consent and clear notification.
Use of Your Personal Data

The Company may use Personal Data for the following purposes:

    To provide and maintain the Application's functionality, including monitoring the Application's performance and stability.

    To provide technical support: The Personal Data You provide may help us diagnose and resolve technical issues with the Application.

    To improve the Application: We may use anonymized usage data to identify bugs, optimize performance, and enhance user experience.

    For legal compliance: We may process Your information to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

**DATA SHARING LIMITATIONS:** 

Unlike commercial services, PwnDroid operates with strict data sharing limitations:

    No data sharing with third parties for commercial purposes
    No data sharing for advertising or marketing purposes  
    No data sharing with affiliates or business partners for promotional purposes
    Data may only be shared when legally required or with your explicit consent for specific technical support purposes

**SECURITY RESEARCH DISCLAIMER:** As a security research tool, PwnDroid may interact with network infrastructure and other devices as part of its intended functionality. Users are responsible for ensuring their use complies with applicable laws and regulations.

Retention of Your Personal Data

The Company will retain Your Personal Data only for as long as necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Given the local nature of PwnDroid:

    Most data is stored locally on your device and can be deleted by you at any time
    We do not maintain centralized servers with user data
    Any data that might be transmitted for support purposes is deleted promptly after the support issue is resolved
    Usage data for improving the Application is retained in anonymized form only

You maintain full control over data stored locally on your device and can delete it at any time through your device's standard file management tools.

Transfer of Your Personal Data

**MINIMAL DATA TRANSFER:** PwnDroid is designed to minimize data transfer. Your information is processed locally on your device. Any data transfer only occurs:

    When explicitly initiated by you for technical support purposes
    When required by law
    When you explicitly opt-in to share anonymized usage statistics for Application improvement

When data transfer does occur, the Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Delete Your Personal Data

You have the right to delete or request that We assist in deleting any Personal Data that We may have collected about You.

**LOCAL DATA CONTROL:** Since PwnDroid operates primarily as a local application:
    You can delete all Application data by uninstalling the Application
    You can clear specific data through the Application's settings
    You can manually delete local data files stored by the Application

For any data that may have been shared for support purposes, you may contact Us to request deletion.
Disclosure of Your Personal Data

**LIMITED DISCLOSURE POLICY:** PwnDroid operates with a strict data minimization approach. Personal Data disclosure is limited to the following specific circumstances:

Business Transactions

As an open-source project, traditional business transactions involving user data transfer do not apply. However, if the project structure changes significantly, users will be notified with at least 30 days advance notice.

Law Enforcement

Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).

Other Legal Requirements

The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:

    Comply with a legal obligation
    Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
    Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Application
    Protect the personal safety of Users of the Application or the public
    Protect against legal liability

**TRANSPARENCY COMMITMENT:** We commit to notifying users of any legal data requests where legally permissible to do so.

Security of Your Personal Data

The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us. PwnDroid implements security measures appropriate for a security research tool:

    Local data storage reduces exposure to network-based attacks
    No central database of user information to be compromised
    Regular security updates and patches
    Open-source codebase allowing for community security review

However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee absolute security.

**SECURITY RESEARCH CONTEXT:** As a security research tool, PwnDroid may interact with potentially insecure networks and systems. Users should be aware of the security implications of using such tools and take appropriate precautions.

Children's Privacy

Our Application does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that information.

**ADDITIONAL PROTECTION:** Given the nature of security research tools, we strongly recommend that PwnDroid only be used by individuals with appropriate technical knowledge and legal authority to use such tools.

Links to Other Websites

Our Application may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If You click on a third-party link, You will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
